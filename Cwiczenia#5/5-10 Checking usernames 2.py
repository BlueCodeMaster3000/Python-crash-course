##  5-10. Checking Usernames: 
# Do the following to create a program that simulates 
#   how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.

# * Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.

# * Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one
#       or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.

# * Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username 
#       has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person 
#           will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used,
#                print a message saying that the username is available.

# * Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. 
#       If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted. 
#           (To do this, youâ€™ll need to make a copy of current_users 
#               containing the lowercase versions of all existing users.)
