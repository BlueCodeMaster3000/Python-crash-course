#    and write an if- else chain.

#   earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

# * If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player 
#   just earned 10 points.

# * Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another 
#   that runs the else block.

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("Congratulations! You earned 5 points!Pog")
if alien_color != 'green':
    print("Congratulations! You earned 10 points!Pog")

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("Congratulations! You earned 5 points!Pog")
