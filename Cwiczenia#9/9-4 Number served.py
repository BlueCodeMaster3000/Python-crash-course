## 9-4. Number Served: 
# 
# Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162). 
# 
# Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. 
# 
# Create an instance called restaurant from this class. 
# 
# Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and then change 
#   this value and print it again.
# 
# - Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number 
#   of customers that have been served. 
# Call this method with a new number and print the value again.
# 
# - Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you 
#   increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. 
# Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many 
#   customers were served in, say, a day of business.
