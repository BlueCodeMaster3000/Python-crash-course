## 9-6. Ice Cream Stand: 
# 
# An ice cream stand is a specific kind of restaurant. 
# 
# Write a class called IceCreamStand that inherits from the Restaurant 
#   class you wrote in Exercise 9-1 (page 162) or Exercise 9-4 (page 167). 
# 
# Either version of the class will work; just pick the one you like better. 
# 
# Add an attribute called flavors that stores a list of ice cream flavors. 
# 
# Write a method that displays these flavors. 
# 
# Create an instance of IceCreamStand, and call this method.

# Ok so the issue is that you can either make a list or just print self.flavors.
# Because there is a word list in exercise I made a function that moves all 
#   the flavors from sel.flavors into list called Ice_flavors ??????
