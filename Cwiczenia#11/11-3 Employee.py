## 11-3. Employee: 
# 
# Write a class called Employee. 
# 
# The __init__() method should take in a first name, a last name, and an annual 
#   salary, and store each of these as attributes. 
# 
# Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5,000 to the annual salary by 
#   default but also accepts a different raise amount.
# 
# Write a test case for Employee. 
# 
# Write two test methods, test_give_default_raise() 
#   and test_give_custom_raise(). 
# 
# Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t have to create a new employee instance 
#   in each test method. 
# 
# Run your test case, and make sure both tests pass.
