##  10-13. Verify User: 
# 
# The final listing for remember_me.py assumes either that the user has 
#   already entered their username or that the program is running for the 
#       first time. 
# 
# We should modify it in case the current user is not the person who last 
#   used the program.
# 
# Before printing a welcome back message in greet_user(), ask the user if this 
#   is the correct username. 
# 
# If itâ€™s not, call get_new_username() to get the correct username.
